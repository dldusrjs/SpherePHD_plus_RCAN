# SpherePHD_plus_RCAN
final_project CS470

SphereParameters/FaceNormalGroup/index holds the vectors of SpherePHD images. This is used for not only project ERP image to SpherePHD image, but also visualize output of SR network.

SpherePHD_SR_RCAN_SUN360_new.ipynb is "Jupyter Notebook" file. You can excute each block sequential.

Running SpherePHD_SR_RCAN_SUN360_new.ipynb produces test_output_SUN_div6_new.mat files in periodically.

You can visualize test_output_SUN_div6_new.mat files to use SR_debug_torch_SUN.m.

SR_debug_torch_SUN.m is matlab files. This code visualizes the SpherePHD image in form of pointcloud.
